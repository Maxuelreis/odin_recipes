    <p>
        Paçoquinha is a traditional Brazilian sweet, prepared 
        in the olden days by crushing the ingredients in a mortar,
        the exact processes used by the indigenous. In fact, the 
        word paçoca comes from the tupi (indigenous) word pa’soka, 
        which means to crumble, crush in the mortar.
        It is a very substantial and tasty candy – a Festas Juninas 
        traditional recipe – widely consumed throughout the whole year.
        In some places, such as the Vale do Paraíba, it is a 
        traditional Easter dessert, and it is said the paçoquinha 
        accompanied by sliced banana and a coffee is “the best thing 
        to eat in the world”. You have also to try a crumbled 
        paçoquinha over your cream ice-cream.
