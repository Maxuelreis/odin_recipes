    <p>
        The “curau” is a very popular pudding and it is a traditional “festas juninas” (June festivities which coincide with the corn harvest) dish, celebrating St. Anthony’s, St. Peter’s and St. John’s Day.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a cheap but very healthy recipe, that was originally made only with water, without milk. A variation of “curau” is the “pamonha”: grated/mixed corn pulp wrapped into corn husk (“corn packets”) and boiled. The “pamonha” has a creamy-smooth consistency, a bit coarser than “curau”.

    <h3>Ingredints:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 sweet corn cobs, around 400g sweet corn kernels</li>
        <li>300-400 ml milk</li>
        <li>75 g sugar</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>cinnamon powder for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Remove kernels from the corn cob with a knife and blend corn pulp with a little milk to a paste. In the traditional recipe corn pulp is grated off the cob.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pass the pulp through a sieve (large aperture), add remaining milk and sugar and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens. This will take about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour on a serving plate or in individual dessert bowls.
        </li>
        <li>Let cool and sprinkle with cinnamon powder.</li>
        <li>Serve warm or cool and store in fridge.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy it!</p>
