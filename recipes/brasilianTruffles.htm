    <p>
        The "brigadeiro" (Brigadier) rules among the "docinhos de 
        leite Mo√ßa" (improved consolidated milk sweetmeats), and it 
        is an unquestionable requirement at birthday celebrations 
        in Brazil.
        It is said that "brigadeiros" were created in 1946 to 
        upgrade the political race of Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes and, 
        from the beginning, they were known as the "Brigadeiro's 
        desserts". Brigadeiro Gomes lost the political race, yet the 
        "brigadeiros" won an avalanche triumph!
